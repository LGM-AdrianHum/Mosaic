# Mosaic
Metro UI style dashboard framework

##What Mosaic is?

Mosaic is an application that brings Metro UI to your desktop. It is a set of live widgets that shows some content from the web or from your PC. Some widgets (e.g. people widget, weather widget) have fullscreen extended view called hub.

##What Mosaic is not?

Mosaic is not an attempt to fully copy Windows 8 UI.
Of course it uses some ideas from Windows 8, just because we like them and we find it useful, but it doesn't mean anything and could be changed in the future.

##Mosaic is in beta stage and can work unstable

###System requirements:
- Windows 7
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (Client Profile enough but full is recommended for future versions)
